# Custom Dink Webhook Handler

A custom webhook that takes in requests from Dink and constructs custom messages that are dependent on checks against the data from Dink.

## Credits

This handler wouldn't have been needed if it wasn't for the [DinkPlugin](https://github.com/pajlads/DinkPlugin). The team was very helpful when it came to metadata and any questions I had along the way.
