# Custom Dink Webhook Handler

A custom webhook that takes in requests from Dink and constructs custom messages that are dependent on checks against the data from Dink.

## [killCountHandler](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/killCountHandler.js)

Checks if a player's kill count for a boss is a notable milestone (every 100 kills, specific boss-defined intervals, or first kills of special bosses) and updates the message map with a formatted notification if applicable. It ensures the boss name is validated and retrieves interval data from constants before constructing and storing the message.

### Boss Map

For select NPCs, the milestone check follows a custom `killCount` interval instead of the default `100`.  

#### Example  
The following configuration triggers notifications every 5 kills for **TzKal-Zuk** and every 25 kills for **Phosani's Nightmare**:  

```javascript
[
  ['TzKal-Zuk', 5],
  ['Phosaniâ€™s Nightmare', 25]
]
```
## [petHandler](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/petHandler.js)

Processes pet-related notifications, particularly for incrementing and retrieving a player's pet count in a MongoDB database. The handler supports both first-time pet drops and duplicate pet drops, adjusting the format and message accordingly. It ensures that the pet name is validated, and provides a system for tracking the pet count. The handler also includes a route for directly updating pet counts, so players can modify their progress in real-time. 

### Pet Count Update Logic

- **Incrementing Pet Count**: The handler supports the ability to increment a player's pet count when a new pet is obtained, ensuring the pet's milestone is recognized.
- **Duplicate Pet Drops**: The handler differentiates between first-time and duplicate drops and updates the message map with appropriate notifications.

### Routes

#### **POST `/increment-pets`**

This endpoint allows the pet count for a given player to be incremented by 1. The playerâ€™s name is sent as part of the request body. It ensures that the pet count is updated in the database, and returns a success message if the operation is successful.

- **Parameters**:
  - `playername` (JSON body): The player whose pet count is to be incremented.

- **Response**:
  - `200 OK`: If the pet count was successfully incremented.
  - `400 Bad Request`: If no `playername` is provided.
  - `404 Not Found`: If the player is not found in the database.
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: If there is an error while updating the database.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/increment-pets" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"playername": "player1"}'
```
#### Example response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "playername": "player1"
}
```

## [collectionLogHandler](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/collectionLogHandler.js)

Handles collection log item notifications by validating the item name and calculating the player's total collection log completion percentage. If total or completed entries are missing, a fallback message is used to prompt the player to refresh their log. This handler now also supports rank-based icons and tracks rank milestones, such as completing a rank or reaching the highest possible rank in the collection log.

### Rank Support

- **Rank-based Icons**: Each rank in the collection log (from Bronze to Gilded) is represented with a unique emoji, displayed alongside the player's completion progress.
- **Rank Milestones**: The handler checks if the player has just completed a new rank and formats a special message to highlight this achievement.
- **Rank Format**: The ranks are displayed in a properly formatted, capitalized form (e.g., Bronze, Iron, etc.).

#### Example Workflow

1. **No Data Available**: If total and completed entries are unavailable (the player hasnâ€™t cycled their collection log), a fallback message prompts them to refresh the log.

2. **Rank Completion**: If the player has just completed a rank, the message will highlight the new rank theyâ€™ve reached, along with their current collection progress.

3. **Normal Update**: For regular collection log additions, the handler provides an update that includes the item name and the player's progress (completed vs total entries).

## [combatTaskHandler](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/combatTaskHandler.js)

Tracks combat achievement progress by formatting completion percentages and structuring notifications for newly completed combat tasks. If a player completes an entire tier, a specialized message highlights their achievement, while regular task completions update their progress within the current tier.

## [personalBestHandler](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/personalBestHandler.js)

Processes and formats in-game ISO-8601 duration strings for personal best times, ensuring consistency in minute, second, and millisecond formatting. Updates the message map with a notification when a player achieves a new personal best for a boss kill.

## [clueScrollHandler](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/clueScrollHandler.js)

Formats and constructs a message for a completed clue scroll, listing the type of clue, the number completed, and the rewards received. Each reward is displayed with its quantity, name, and formatted price.

## [chatHandler](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/chatMsgHandler/chatHandler.js)

Handles different types of chat messages by delegating the processing to the appropriate handler based on the message type (e.g., [Big Fish](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/chatMsgHandler/bigFishHandler.js), [Vestige Drop](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/chatMsgHandler/vestigeHandler.js), [Sepulchre Personal Best](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/chatMsgHandler/sepulchreHandler.js)).

## [levelUpHandler](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/levelUpHandler.js)

Constructs special messages for significant level-up milestones, including max total level, total level intervals of 25, and reaching level 99 in a skill. A key feature of this function is handling multiple level-ups in a single notification, ensuring all skills are listed in one message rather than separately.
#### Example of a single skill level-up:<br/>

> playerName has leveled Attack to 99!<br/>

#### Examples of multiple skill level-ups:<br/>

>playerName has leveled Attack and Strength to 99!<br/>
>playerName has leveled Attack, Strength, and Defence to 99!<br/>

## [deathHandler](https://github.com/jdanthdavis/custom-dink-webhook/blob/main/src/core/deathHandler.js)

Handles player death events by formatting and updating a death message based on whether the death occurred in PvP or PvM. If the player was killed by another player, the message includes the killerâ€™s name and the amount of coins lost. Otherwise, it generates a standard death message. Random humorous emojis are appended to each death message for added flavor.

### Death Message Logic

- **PvP Death**: Includes the killer's name and the value of coins lost.
- **PvM or Other Death**: Displays a simple death message without financial loss or killer information.
- **Randomized Emojis**: Each message randomly selects an emoji from a predefined list to add character to the notification.

#### Example Workflow

1. **PvP Death**: If the death was player-vs-player (PvP), the message follows the format:

   > **playerName** has just been killed by **killerName** for **valueLost** coins ðŸ˜„

2. **PvM Death**: If not PvP, the message follows the simpler format:

   > **playerName** has died ðŸ˜„

3. **Randomized Humor**: Each death message is enhanced with a randomly selected emoji for humor and personalization.
